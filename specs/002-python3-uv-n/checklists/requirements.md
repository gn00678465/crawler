# Specification Quality Checklist: Web Crawler CLI Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Validation Iterations**: 1

### Clarifications Resolved

1. **Output Directory Creation (Q1)**: Auto-create directories and parent directories automatically
2. **Redirect Handling (Q2)**: Follow redirects automatically up to 5 hops
3. **Timeout Configuration (Q3)**: Use Firecrawl library's default timeout settings

### Key Decisions

- Firecrawl library will be used for web crawling (documented in Assumptions)
- This enables both static and dynamic (JavaScript-rendered) content handling
- API credentials/configuration assumed to be set up in environment

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
